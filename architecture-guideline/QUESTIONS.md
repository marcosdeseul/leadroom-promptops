## 3. API Usage Patterns

### Primary Workflow

**Q7.1**: What's the expected API workflow?
- [ ] **Scenario A**: Submit prompt → Get optimized version immediately
- [x] **Scenario B**: Submit prompt + context → Get LLM response → Collect feedback → Auto-optimize over time

- [ ] LLM response + suggested prompt improvements
- [x] Configurable per tenant

### Async Operations & Webhooks

**Q8.1**: Should optimization be asynchronous?

### Rate Limiting & Credits

**Q9.1**: What rate limiting strategy?

- [ ] Dynamic based on usage patterns

**Q9.2**: Should the platform have a credit system?
- [ ] Yes - charge credits per API call

- [x] Hybrid (base subscription + usage overages)

**Q9.3**: How should credits be tracked?
- [x] Real-time balance updates
- [ ] Hourly/daily aggregation
- [x] Warn when credits low
- [x] Auto-stop when depleted vs. overage allowed -> auto-stop
